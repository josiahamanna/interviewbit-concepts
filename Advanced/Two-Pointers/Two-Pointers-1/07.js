/*
Given n non-negative integers A[0], A[1], â€¦, A[n-1] , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, A[i]).

N vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, A[i]) and (i, 0).

Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Note: You may not slant the container.
