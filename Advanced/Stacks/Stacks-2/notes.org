* Stacks 2
** Nearest small element
For every index i, find the nearest element on left which is smaller than arr[i].
For ex:    index:  0 1  2 3  4  5
         element:  4 5  2 10 8  2
nearest smallest: -1 4 -1 2  2 -1
Brute force: For every index i, traverse from i-1 to 0 until you get a smaller element than a[i]
             Complexity will be O(N^2)
Improve: Maintain stack in increasing order.
#+begin_src C
  ans = [];
  for(i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    while(st.empty() && st.top() >= arr[i]) {
      st.pop();
    }
    if(st.empty()) ans[i] = -1;
    else ans[i] = st.top();

    st.push([arr[i]]);
   }
#+end_src
Complexity: every element is entering stack only once. So it is O(N).
If the question is *nearest smaller element on the right* -> Iterate from right.
