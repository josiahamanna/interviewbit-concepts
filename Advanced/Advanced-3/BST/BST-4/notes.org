* BST 4
** Circular doubly linked list
[[./screenshots/circular-doubly-linked-list.png]]
1. Head's previous is linking to tail. Tail's next is pointing to head.
2. A single node is also a circular doubly linked list as shown in the picture.
** Problem
1. Given two circular doubly linked list, combine them into 1 circular doubly linked list and return head.
2. Straight forward
   1. Say, you are given a CDLL1 and CDLL2
   2. Make CDLL1's tail's next point to CDLL2 head.
   3. Make CDLL2's head's previous point to CDLL1's tail.
   4. Make CDLL2's tail's next point to CDLL1's head.
   5. Make CDLL1's head's previous point to CDLL2 tail.
3. Pseudo code
   #+begin_src C
CNode combine(CNode n1, CNode n2) {
  if (n1 == NULL && n2 == NULL) return NULL;
  if (n1 == NULL) return n2;
  if (n2 == NULL) return n1;
  // get the tail of both
  CNode t1 = n1.prev;
  CNode t2 = n2.prev;

  // make connections
  t1.next = n1;
  n2.prev = t1;
  t2.next = n1;
  n1.prev = t2;

  return n1;
}
   #+end_src
** Given a BST, convert it into sorted circular doubly linked list.
1. Example
   [[./screenshots/bst-to-circular-doubly-linked-list.png]]
2. Constraint is that you cannot store the BST to an array.
3. Recursion approach. Assumption: Given BST, the function converts it to sorted CDLL and returns it's head.
   1. Call this function on root's left and assign it to lable leftCDLL.
   2. Call this function on root's right and assign it to lable rightCDLL.
   3. Call combine function on leftCDLL and root and assign it to lable combinedLeftCDLLANDRoot;
   4. Call combine function on combinedLeftCDLLANDRoot and rightCDLL.
   5. Base condition will be if root == NULL then return NULL.
4. Pseudo code
   #+begin_src C
Node convert(Node root) {
  if(root == NULL) return NULL;

  Node leftCDLL = convert(root.left);
  Node rightCLL = convert(root.right);

  root.left = root;
  root.right = root;

  return combine((combine(leftCDLL, root), rightCDLL);
}
   #+end_src
5. TC: O(N), SC: O(N). We can do it SC in O(1) using Morris algorithm (Use prev pointer).
** Calculate no of nodes at a distance k from root node.
1. Pseudo code
   #+begin_src C
int distance(Node root, int k) {
  if(root == NULL || k < 0) {
    return 0;
  }
  if(k == 0) return 1;

  int l = distance(root.left, k-1);
  int r = distance(root.right, k-1);

  return l + r;
}
   #+end_src
2. TC: O(N); SC: O(N)
** Calculate no of nodes at a distance k from given source node
1. We can traverse backwards as well (not just children, but parents children). Refer diagram.
