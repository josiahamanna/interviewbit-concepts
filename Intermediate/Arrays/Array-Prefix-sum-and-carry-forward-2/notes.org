* Array - Prefix sum and carry forward 2
** No of equilibrium index of an array
1. Sum of all array elements before all ith index = sum of all aray elements after ith index
2. sum [0, i-1] = sum [i+1, n-1]
3. Note 1: for i = 0 we can assume sum of all it's left = 0
4. Note 0: for i = N-1 we can assume sum of all it's right = 0  
** Closest Min Max
1. Given an array find the length of the smallest subarray which contains both min and max of subarray
